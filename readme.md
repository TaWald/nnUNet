# Introducing Primus: A pure Transformer-based 3D semantic segmentation architecture
Primus is a pure Transformer-based 3D semantic segmentation architecture. It is the first of its kind and is designed to be a strong baseline for 3D semantic segmentation tasks. Primus is built on top of the nnU-Net framework and is fully compatible with it. It is designed to be easy to use and can be trained on any 3D dataset with minimal effort. Primus is a part of the nnU-Net framework and is available as a new configuration in the nnU-Net.
